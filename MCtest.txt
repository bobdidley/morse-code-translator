Despite the app, or whatever other method you used to learn, I would say that you demonstrated the two most important things to learning Morse code: motivation and enthusiasm.
If you have those two, almost any learning technique will work. One thing I would caution is to learn the characters, whether receiving or sending, by their sounds.
You mentioned getting paddles; when you get to a certain speed, you'll have to know what a '1' sounds like, not what it is composed of.
I don't think anybody should think in terms of dits and dahs. Each character has a unique sound.
Glad you're enjoying Morse code. It's time for you to get on the air and make some contacts. Keep at it and have fun.
